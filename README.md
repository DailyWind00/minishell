A simple Bash

I did this project with Tuvosyl
- ![Tuvosyl Github](https://github.com/tuvosyl)

This project use the readline function, causing some leaks and weirds issues in the code, to fix the leaks, use :
```shell
valgrind --suppressions="rl.supp" ./minishell
```

We didn't use a tokeniser for minishell, instead we made our own algorythm :
The program is divided in 4 parts :
  - Reading
  - Checking
  - Parsing
  - Executing
(Keep in mind that I did the checking/parsing parts and Tuvosyl did the reading/executing/leaks parts)

## Reading
The reading part is very small, as it only contain the readline function.

## Checking
The checking part verify the command put in the readline function, if the command 
  - have unclosed quotes,
  - have unclosed pipes,
  - have unclosed redirection,
then the program return to the reading part.

This part is very usefull for later as in the parsing you'll have the garanty of a valid command.

## Parsing
The parsing part parse the command into a command struct like this :
  - It split the command string with the pipes,
  - It set the environment variables if there's any,
  - It parse the redirections and remove them from the string,
  - It split the last inputs with the whitespaces in a list as they are the command and arguments.

At the end of the parsing it look like this :

## Executing
The executing part is the final part, it take the command list and must comport exactly like bash :
  - First it check if there is pipes or redirections

To use the program, you must do these commands :
```shell
cd minishell
make

# Program :
./minishell
```

You also have these commands for cleaning the minishell directory :
```shell
# Clean all object files (*.o)
make clean

# Clean executable & object files
make fclean

# Clean everything and recompile the executable
make re
```

There's also a debug mode for this program, to use it you must use :
```shell
make debug
```
(/!\ Keep in mind the debugger is only for understanding the parsing and can cause unexpected behavior as it's not mandatory /!\)
